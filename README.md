it is completely based on prediction model using random forest and lstm. The predictions are happening on the sensor data with temperature and pressure sensors. All after getting this data I am checking the value for the threshold of bothe the sensor. After we are getting the value and we have the historic values also then we are doing the prediction. 
if anyone have any suggestions he can direct contact me on @fastrack50m@gmail.com
